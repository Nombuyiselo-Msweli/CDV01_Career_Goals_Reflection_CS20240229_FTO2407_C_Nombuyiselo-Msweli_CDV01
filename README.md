### Personal Information

- **Name: Nombuyiselo Msweli**
- **Date: 19 July 2024**
- **Current Role/Position: Student at Codespace academy**
- **Field of Interest: front-end development and web design**
- **Personality Type: INFJ-T - Advocate**

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

## 1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
### Current skills:
  - **Brand/ project design and management**.I was a freelancer for 2 years working as social media manager and brand designer. My clients consisted of small business such as local fashion designer Oyama Gonintebe, cleaning companies, influencers/ media personalities and a free walking tours company (Cape Town Free Walking Tours), all based out of Cape Town. The services I enjoyed providing most was helping my clients define their brand identity through curated visuals, logo design, colours, typography and copywriting. 
    
  - **Teaching**. Whilst at university, I tutored highschool students in subject such as Biology, Mathematics, English Home Language and Consumer studies. I loved curating and creating lesson plans, study notes, compiling learning resources and rceeiving feedback from their parents. All the students I tutored passed their subject with 75% and higher, two of them passing with distinctions from having been scraping by at 65% aggregate in their subjects. The joy of seeing my student's finally understand & find success in a subject with which they were struggling was an absolute joy. 

  - **Creating sysytems and effective workflows**. Being self-employed whilst studying required me to put systems in place to prevent burnout. I successfully created workflows and documented systems that I utilized on a daily basis and upon receving interested business leads. I had to create professional client onboarding and offboarding processes that were easily replicable and implemnted. I enjoy creating systems thoroughly, especially when I can add design flair to it's assets such as documents or templates. 

  - **Basic graphic design and copywriting (Organising information in a visually appealling manner)**. The clients for whom I worked required professional and appealing marketing assets, templates and documents. I was tasked with the creation and distribution of such marketing materials. We received many positive reviews, returning customers, and recurring brand deals as a result of the effectiveness of our positioning, branding and copywriting.

  - **Event organising and decor planning**. Artistic painting. I have been painting since I was child, having started art classes in grade 7 and while I haven't done much professional illustration, I hope to in the future by combining my love for illustartion with creating unique brand assets like patterns for businesses. 

  - **Event organising and decor planning**. I am a very active member of my church community, at FaithPoint church, and fulfill the role of event planner there. I have, over the past 4 years, been entrusted with planning decor for conferences, high teas for the ladies ministry, church camp, youth ministry services and intimate meetings. Through the experience I have learned how to lead people, organise vendors, co-ordinate schedules and communicate instruction effectively. 
   
### Skills I need to develop or improve:
   - **Taking criticsm too personally**. As my personality type would suggest I am very in tune with my emotions, often to a fault. I struggle to accept that I will not do everything perfectly and see critiscm not as something valuable but as a personal attack on my character. I understand that this sometime hinders my ability to collaborate effectively . I am on a journey to accept myself through the self authoring program created by Dr Jordan B Petersen. 

   - **Procrastination of tasks with uncertain outcomes**. Whever I am approaching a project or life situation in which I am uncertain of what the end result will be (e.g. starting to learn a new skill or pursuing cold outreach to get leads and clients), I tend to procrastinate starting. This, as one can imagine, only adds to the anxiety. I am working on embracing new challenges and reminding myself of the skills I've acquired through putting in the work consistently. 


   - **Communicating frustration and asking for help**. I have a tendency to think that I can be wonder woman. Partly because I can feel guilty to burden people with my responsibilities and partly because I can be too proud to humble myself. I am learning to accept the limits of capabilities and seek knowledge from those ahead of me when I struggle. I am working on practising recognizing where I am overhwlemed and effectively communicating where I need assistance.


   - **Reframing failure as tool for learning**. I have been an over achiever my entire life. For a very long time I placed my value and worth in the things (grades, sports awards, academic awards and social acceptance) and accolades that I have acquired. As one can imagine, this made accepting failure extremely difficult for me. The first 3 years of university presented incredibly difficult times for me academically as well as personally and it lft my academic confidence absolutely shattered. I realised that they way in which I viewed failure was hindering my progress. Additionally, they way in which I learn best was not suited for the university ecosystem. As a solution I freelanced and enrolled eventually to CodeSpace where I could learn at my own pace, face failure (mistakes) regularily and apply what I learn practically.  

   
###**Interests and Values**:
1. **Interests Realted to career**:
    - Graphic and Interior design.  This interest relates to deisgning effective websites and applications. It help me raise my own awreness of spacial design and layout, coordination of different elements, the conveyed message or voice that can be spoken through design and understanding colour theory in real world applications.

    - Reading. Reading helps me become more articulate but more importantly it helps me nuture my compassion for other people. I am one that enjoys and is curious about what motivates people. Reading allows me to see inside the heads of all kinds of people and make an effort towards understanding them better. This will be helpful in how I articulate my ideas and collaborate with others.

    - Writing. Writing helps me formulate the communication of my ideas into an easy to understand format. This will be particularily helpful regarding conveying complex technical ideas to non-technical co-workers in the future. 

    - Illustration. This will be incredibly useful in creating rand-specific creative assets like vector drawings and patterns. This personalisation of assets will help businesses truly stand out amongst the crowds and make my services seem all the more valuable. AI can design but it can't (at least not yet) tailor every tiny detail of a deisgn to a particular business owner's vision. I'm talking about changing fonts with inflictions, manipulating shape specific to a brand message etc. AI doesn't know how to inject design with personality nor humanity, which makes the skill of illustrating and design all the more useful to business owners with a vision.

    - UI/UX design. This interest would serve my career in that it would allow me to approach every project with a consumer-first mindset. It would help me pay careful attention to useability, adaptability and accessibility of every web or brand design project as well as their development. 

2. **Values important to me in a work environment**
   (In order of most important to lesser so.)

    - Geographical freedom (Remote work) - the ability to work from anywhere around the world. It has been a dream of mine for the past 6 years to be able to travel the world, to see all that the Lord has created. But, I did not want to do this while being broke therefore remote work is the answer.

    - Stability - I need the stability of a larger company, the turbulance of start-ups is not for me. I need stability in order to feel confident enough to then explore more creative passions. I am not a fan of the phrase "follow your passion" as it can mislead people into thinking that purely due to being passionate, financial gain is owed to them. The reality is, one has to be good at their passion in order to earn a living from it and to become profiecient enough to be good requires a stable income stream.

    - Purposeful and meaningful work. Work that genuinely improves the lives of other people is a need for my professional life. I need to beleive in the mission of the company to give my 100% in that environment. Additionally, I would love to go home everyday (or log off of work) feeling fulfilled and that I helped someone move the needle forward in their own lives or businesses due to something that I helped create/design/develop.

    - Organised systems of communication. I need to receive clear instruction and know avenues to which quiries should be directed when they come up. Unorganized systems, workflows and hierarchy lead me to becoming anxious and unsure of myself.

    - Opportunities for growth. The environment needs to be challenging enough to keep me on my toes and continue to develop my skillset as a deisgner and developer. I understand the importance of self learning but in addition to this I would greatly appreciate a work environment that encourages personal growth.

    - Flexibility of work projects. I think I would thrive in an environemnt where the pay is stable but the type of projects that I work on change regularily. I would like to be forced to think outside the box and have my creative problem solving skills put to the test.

## Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
   Industries and roles I researched:
    - Healthcare abd Medicine. The company was called ' Pain-Free Dental' and the role they were advertising was for a 'web developer'. The required them to be profiecient in skills such as: css, react.js, Svelte, Wordpress, Webflow, CMS technologies, and UX principles.

    - Agriculture. The company was called ' Agrigistics' and the role they were advertising was for a 'Front-end Software Engineer'. The required them to be profiecient in skills such as: the ones listed above icluding problem-solving skills, being a self-starter, good communication, the ability to convey complex technical concepts effectively anf thriving in a collaborative enironment.

    - IT Consulting. The company was called ' Bridge Labs' and the role they were advertising was for a 'Junior Software Engineer'. The required them to be profiecient in skills such as: All of the above listed including .Net framework, Object-Oriented programming, and back-end development.

    - IT- App development. The company was called ' Glucode' and the role they were advertising was for a 'Junior Software engineer- Android'. The required them to be profiecient in skills such as: all of the above inclduing a degree in computer science, 1-2 years work experience, and the desire to learn and grow with them.

   - Media & Advertising. The company was called ' Wetpaint Advertising' and the role they were advertising was for a 'Junior web developer'. The required them to be profiecient in skills such as: all listed above with the addition of project management skills, Angular JS, Amber, MongoDB, MySQL, Python, PHP and attenton to detail. 

    - IT and tech services. The company was called ' IMS' and the role they were advertising was for a 'Web developer'. The required them to be profiecient in skills such as: most listed above with the addition of a portfolio, skills in basic Adobe Photoshop, Wordpress CMS, Video editing and love for creating animations. 

2. **Areas that piqued my interest**:
    - Web development and the required skills such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript as those are the languages I most enjoy as opposed to MySQL or back-end languages.
    - 3rd party softwares such as Webflow, adobe, react js,
    - The need for understanding and implementing ux principles.
    - Many of the roles were either hybrid or remote working roles.
3. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:

    These roles align with my love for design, systems and illustration. They require proficiency in understanding a consumer centric approach to design and would allow me to explore my creativity with challenging development projects for their clients. Many of these companies seem to be smaller such as IMS, Agrigistics, Wetpaint Advertising and Glucode. This is cause for concern as they seem to want talent more experienced than I. I beleive tha if I dedicate myself to developing my skills beyond what is typical of a junior, I can be successful in communicating competence and capabilities to potential employers larger than these companies.
   
## Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    - Goal 1: Learn the fundamental of web developemnt in 6 months and be able to code, style and deploy a professional protfolio. This would hopefully be completed by December 2024.
    - Goal 2: Learn UI/UX principles in 3 months and be able to present a case study for a fictional business in which I have designed user profiles, wireframes and provided rationale behind design decisions. This would hopefully be completed by March 2025, part-time whileworking.
    - Goal 3: Learn professional graphic design and illustraion using Skillshare in 9 months. By the end of it I hope to produce a brand design with digital assets designed according to a generated brief solving a business' problem to be included in my portfolio. This would hopefully be completed by December 2025, part time while working.

**rationale**
- Goal 1: In order to become a hirable web designer and developer, I need to acquire the skills that I lack such as programming languages, soft skills beneficial in a professional work environment and understanding of the web + servers. I would not able to be an effective hire if i lacked such skills necessary to get the job done. Therefore, a foundation must be laid to begin the path to being a great web developer and designer.
- Goal 2: In order for me to successfully convince clients that I can help them achieve their business goals, I need to understand how to divulge and lay out the needs of their customers and how to meet them with practical design. The only way in which I can successfully achieve this confidence in my skills is to dedicate time to learning about UI/UX principles and how to best apply them.  
- Goal 3: In order to convince the companies that I'll be applying to and future clients that my skillset is irreplaceable (for the time being), I need to understand how to create a powerhouse of a customised brand and web presence that is curated to highlight the personality of a business. The way to achieve this that appeals to my personal skillset and interests is learning graphic design and illustration. An effective and cost efficient way to do this would be to learn through the monthly subscription learning platform skillshare, where creatives from all over the world share their years of knowledge and expertise.
  
3. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    - Aspiration 1: Work to learn, not to earn at an entry-level web development job for 5 years. All while creating helpful content on linkedin to showcase my experrtise and helping other deisgners thrive and helping other young women break into a career in tech. I'm not aspiring to be a content creator, but a leading voice in my field. 
    - Aspiration 2: Become a high ticket freelance web and brand designer & illustrator after approx. 5 years of work experience. 
      
  **Interest and skill alignment**:
  - Aspiration 1: I have beginner level skills and thus an entry level job is most relaistic. My primary focus is to work to learn because I want to grow and develop my skill set at a high rate of improvement per year. The more skilled I am, the more I am worth and the higher I will be saught after in the job market. As I grow in my proficiencies and become saught after (with the help of having created a booming Linkedin social media presence), I will be able to more easily funnel that attention and expertise to a successful freelancing career.
- Aspiration 2: I would like to freeance so that I have the time freedom in addition to the geographical freedom to explore my other passions and interests. In addition to this I want to have control over what projects I work on (so I can choose those that bring the most purpose to my life), whom I work with (the caliber and character of client), where I work from (travelling the world on my own schedule) and how I work (having freedom of medium, design direction and systems design).  

## Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    - Complete CodeSpace Academy courses. With the foundational knowledge laid down i will be able to build upon acquired skills to further my development in my chosen field. 
    - Enroll in Coder Coder course "Responsive Web design". A course that is designed for beginner wed designers and developers aimed at taking us through a complete design from figma to launch. 
    - Purchase subscription to Skillshare. An online learning platform through which I'll be able to leevrage the years of experience of other creatives to develop my skills. 
    - Create a portfolio website. My didgital reputation's home, here I will share everything there is to know about my design style, projects I have worked on and the value that i'll add to any company or business.
    - Purchase "Self-Authoring suite" created by DR. Jordan B Petersen. A writing suite that encourages deep self reflection and planning fr the future through self acceptance, trauma exploration, and the disecting of our dreams and aspirations. it is highly acclaimed and encourage deep self responsibility. 
    - Purchase graphic designer Will Paterson's design course "Logo Launch". Will paterson is renowed for his timeless logo designs and has valuable knowledge to impart on anyone who is willing to listen and engage.
      
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Enroll in Flux Academy's Freelance Web designer course. The coordinator at flux academy have over 20 years experience freelancing as a brand and web deisgner. i have enjoyed many of their free resources and videos , thus I feel confident that I will be in good hands with their guidance as I venture into planning for a freelancing career.
    - Purchacse graphic designer Abi Connick's course " The client process for freelance designers". Abi Connick's style of graphic design is akin to my own, I love the way she implements design principles and teaches them in digestible ways. I am confident that I will benefit highly from her advice on creating a professional client experience for high ticket clients.
    - Continuosly create and update my portfolio website with the most recent projects and design case studies. Constantly showcasing my skills, style, though process and projects will help businesses and clients determine whetehr on not I am a good match for them and thus generate much needed business leads. 
    - Continuosly create content and resources to help other young women and designers break into tech. I need to position myself as an expert in my field, and the most effective way in which to do this is to help real people and share the knowledge that I will be acquiring with them. When one is able to help a bsuiness owner solve a real problem for their business, they will become a super fan and refer their friends & family, creating more business for one. 

## Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Financial Constraint. I do not come from a wealthy family. Having had to pay for all my schooling with bursaries and scholarships, finances will almost defintely be a hinderance for me. Strategy to overcome: Applying for local governemnt social grants or Working another part-time job to pay for courses or once settled in a junior position I could begin a savings account dedicated to further learning and skills development. 
    - Time constraint. I have poor time management skills and thus end up feeling overwhelemed by all of the things that I want to achieve. Strategy to overcome: First practice self acceptance and that I am limited in what I can do at once. Split my interests into focus periods of 12 weeks each and make use of productivity planners such as Notion to organise ideas.
    - State of the current job market locally. The job market locally is highly competitive with many companies caring about degrees and tertiary qualifications. Strategy to overcome: Focus efforts on appllying for remote jobs from companies overseas that would allow me geographical freedom even though time freedom would be sacrificed.
      
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Attendning industry networking events.
    - Taking advantage of Linkedin and asking for mentorship by someone who is already successful in my field.
    - Leveraging online learning platforms such as skillshare, Adobe Classroom and W3Schools to continuosly pursue skill development.
