### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

## 1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
### Current skills:
  - **Brand/ project design and management**.I was a freelancer for 2 years working as social media manager and brand designer. My clients consisted of small business such as local fashion designer Oyama Gonintebe, cleaning companies, influencers/ media personalities and a free walking tours company (Cape Town Free Walking Tours), all based out of Cape Town. The services I enjoyed providing most was helping my clients define their brand identity through curated visuals, logo design, colours, typography and copywriting. 
    
  - **Teaching**. Whilst at university, I tutored highschool students in subject such as Biology, Mathematics, English Home Language and Consumer studies. I loved curating and creating lesson plans, study notes, compiling learning resources and rceeiving feedback from their parents. All the students I tutored passed their subject with 75% and higher, two of them passing with distinctions from having been scraping by at 65% aggregate in their subjects. The joy of seeing my student's finally understand & find success in a subject with which they were struggling was an absolute joy. 

  - **Creating sysytems and effective workflows**. Being self-employed whilst studying required me to put systems in place to prevent burnout. I successfully created workflows and documented systems that I utilized on a daily basis and upon receving interested business leads. I had to create professional client onboarding and offboarding processes that were easily replicable and implemnted. I enjoy creating systems thoroughly, especially when I can add design flair to it's assets such as documents or templates. 

  - **Basic graphic design and copywriting (Organising information in a visually appealling manner)**. The clients for whom I worked required professional and appealing marketing assets, templates and documents. I was tasked with the creation and distribution of such marketing materials. We received many positive reviews, returning customers, and recurring brand deals as a result of the effectiveness of our positioning, branding and copywriting.

  - **Event organising and decor planning**. I am a very active member of my church community, at FaithPoint church, and fulfill the role of event planner there. I have, over the past 4 years, been entrusted with planning decor for conferences, high teas for the ladies ministry, church camp, youth ministry services and intimate meetings. Through the experience I have learned how to lead people, organise vendors, co-ordinate schedules and communicate instruction effectively. 
   
### Skills I need to develop or improve:
   - **Taking criticsm too personally**. As my personality type would suggest I am very in tune with my emotions, often to a fault. I struggle to accept that I will not do everything perfectly and see critiscm not as something valuable but as a personal attack on my character. I understand that this sometime hinders my ability to collaborate effectively and am on a journey to accept myself through the self authoring program created by Dr Jordan B Petersen. 

   - **Procrastination of tasks with uncertain outcomes**.

   - **Communicating frustration and asking for help**.

   - **Reframing failure as tool for learning**.
